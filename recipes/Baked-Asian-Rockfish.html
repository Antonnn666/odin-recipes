    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (6 ounce) rockfish filets</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely minced fresh ginger</li>
    </ul>   
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a shallow baking pan with aluminum foil, and spray with cooking spray. Place filets onto the prepared baking pan.</p>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a very large pot over medium-high heat. Cover the bottom of the pot with one layer of the mushroom-onion mixture. Cook, without moving them around too much, until they begin to brown and caramelize on one side, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir and cook another 3 to 5 minutes to brown the other side. Transfer to a large bowl using a slotted spoon. Add 2 tablespoons oil to the pot, and repeat with another batch. Continue until all mushrooms and onions are cooked.</p>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle filets with scallions before serving.</p>
